    *   Include the units for each value (e.g., 10 m/s).

2.  **To Find:**
    *   Clearly state what quantity needs to be calculated.

3.  **Formula:**
    *   State the relevant formula or formulas that will be used to solve the problem.
    *   All formulas MUST be enclosed in **bold asterisks**. For example: **F = m * a**.
    *   **Critically, do not use LaTeX or any complex mathematical syntax like '$...$' or '\\frac'.** Instead, represent all formulas using simple, keyboard-friendly characters.

If a quantity does not have a symbol in the textbook, do not invent one.
  **Critically, do not use LaTeX or any complex mathematical syntax like '$...$' or '\\frac'.** Instead, represent all formulas using simple, keyboard-friendly characters and standard Unicode symbols for Greek letters and mathematical operators (e.g., Δ, ε, π, θ, √, →). For subscripts, use Unicode characters (e.g., v₀, I₁). If a Unicode subscript is not available, write it out as a word (e.g., "K initial", "V final"). **Under no circumstances use underscores (_).** For example, use **F = m * a** or **Δx = v₀t + (1/2)at²**.
